**Project Overview: Exploring the Key Features of Power BI – Analyzing the Sales Data (RFM Segmentation)**

This project demonstrates how Microsoft Power BI can transform raw business data into actionable insights using advanced data modeling, visualization, and analytics features.
The analysis is based on a sales dataset (2020–2022) from an automotive company and focuses on uncovering sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and regional insights.

🎯 Objectives
Build a data-driven dashboard to analyze sales, profit, and returns over time.
Apply data modeling (Star & Snowflake Schema) to establish relationships between fact and dimension tables.
Implement DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate custom KPIs such as revenue, profit margin, and return rate.
Use Power Query for data cleaning, transformation, and dynamic loading of multiple CSV files.
Apply RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to classify customers and identify business opportunities.
Explore Power BI’s interactive and AI-driven features like bookmarks, drill-throughs, smart narrative, and forecasting.
